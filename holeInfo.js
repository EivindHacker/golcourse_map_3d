export const holeInfo = [null ,`The opening hole is a very long par 5 where going for the green in two is not recommended. If you avoid the bunkers on the tee shot and second shot, the hole is manageable. A "greedy" stream crosses diagonally in front of the green. Favor the left side on approach to the green, which slopes from left to right.<br><br>Pro tips:<br>Don't be afraid to use an extra shot short of the stream if you have a long approach. Conservative play is often the smartest.<br><br>NOTE. At the end of the fairway, on the hill to the right, there is a partially hidden house that can be reached, so be careful on the approach shot and stay to the left.`];
